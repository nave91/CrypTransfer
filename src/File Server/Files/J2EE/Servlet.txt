This article introduces servlets and shows how they can be used in applications written in 
accordance with the Sun BluePrints Design Guidelines for the JavaTM 2 Platform, Enterprise
 Edition (J2EE). The article presents an example servlet that you can invoke, study, and 
-- if you like -- download for more experimentation.

The example servlet is named Guestbook. When you invoke it, the servlet displays a Guestbook
 page and prompts you to type in some information about yourself. When you fill in the 
requested data and click a Submit button, the servlet checks to see if you have provided 
all the data that it feels it needs for a complete database entry. If you have failed to 
fill in any critical fields -- not just any fields, but any critical fields -- the servlet
 prompts you to supply the missing data.

Finally, when the servlet has collected all the information it has asked for, it adds the
 data you have entered to a text file that serves as a database.

To see how the Guestbook servlets works, you must compile it and then install it on a Web 
server -- or, if you don't have access to a Web server, on a workstation equipped with 
special software for running servlets locally. One such software package is the servletrunner
 tool.

Whether you decide to compile and invoke the servlet or not, you'll get an opportunity 
later in this article take a look at its source file. You can also examine the source file
 of the HTML page that invokes the servlet. If you like, you can download both the servlet
and the HTML page that calls it. Then, if you like, you can download and install servletrunner
 and play around with Guestbook servlet at your leisure -- and, perhaps, use it as a stepping 
stone for creating similar servlets of your own.
