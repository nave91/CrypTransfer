What Is the Struts Framework?
The Struts Framework is a standard for developing well-architected Web applications.
 It has the following features: 

•Open source
•Based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm, distinctly separating
 all three levels: 
?Model: application state
?View: presentation of data (JSP, HTML)
?Controller: routing of the application flow
•Implements the JSP Model 2 Architecture
•Stores application routing information and request mapping in a single core file,
 struts-config.xml
The Struts Framework, itself, only fills in the View and Controller layers. The
 Model layer is left to the developer.
