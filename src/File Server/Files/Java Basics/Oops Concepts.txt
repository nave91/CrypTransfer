Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer science term used to characterize a programming
 language that began development in the 1960’s. The term ‘object-oriented programming’ was 
originally coined by Xerox PARC to designate a computer application that describes the methodology
 of using objects as the foundation for computation. By the 1980’s, OOP rose to prominence as 
the programming language of choice, exemplified by the success of C++. Currently, OOPs such as
 Java, J2EE, C++, C#, Visual Basic.NET, Python and JavaScript are popular OOP programming 
languages that any career-oriented Software Engineer or developer should be familiar with. 

OOP is widely accepted as being far more flexible than other computer programming languages.
 OOPs use three basic concepts as the fundamentals for the programming language: classes, 
objects and methods. Additionally, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Event Handling 
and Encapsulation are also significant concepts within object-oriented programming languages
 that are explained in online tutorials describing the functionality of each concept in detail. 

High-end jobs with well-paid salaries are offered around the world for experts in software 
development using object-oriented programming languages. The OOPs concepts described and 
explained in easy to use, step-by-step, practical tutorials will familiarize you with all
 aspects of OOPs.
