Working from the Command Line
If you will be working from the command line only, save Calculator.fx to a directory of your choice. Assuming 
that the JDK and JavaFX SDK are already installed and in your path, you should be able to compile this program
 with the following command:

javafxc Calculator.fx
 
 
After compilation, you will find that the corresponding Java bytecode has been generated and placed into a 
file named calculator.class.

You can now run the compiled class in the Java Virtual Machine with the following command:

javafx Calculator
 
 
The output is:

100 + 2 = 102
100 - 2 = 98
100 * 2 = 200
100 / 2 = 50
 
 
This application may be small, but it introduces you to some important programming language constructs 
(discussed in the next lesson). Learning these constructs is your first step towards mastering the JavaFX 
Script programming language.
