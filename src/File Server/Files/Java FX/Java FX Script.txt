JavaFX Script is a scripting language designed by Sun Microsystems, forming part of the JavaFX family 
of technologies on the Java Platform. JavaFX targets the Rich Internet Application domain (competing 
with Adobe Flex and Microsoft Silverlight), specializing in rapid development of visually rich 
applications for the desktop and mobile markets. JavaFX Script works with integrated development 
environments such as NetBeans and Eclipse. JavaFX is released under the
 GNU General Public License, via the Sun sponsored OpenJFX project.

JavaFX Script is a compiled, statically typed, declarative, scripting language for the Java Platform.
 It provides automatic data-binding, mutation triggers and declarative animation, using an expression
 language syntax (all code blocks potentially yield values.)

Through its standard JavaFX APIs it supports retained mode vector graphics, video playback and 

standard Swing components.
Although F3 began life as an interpreted language, prior to the first preview release (Q3 2008)
 JavaFX Script had shifted focus to being predominantly compiled. Interpreted JavaFX Script is 
still possible, via the JSR 223 'Scripting for Java' bridge. Because it is built on top of the 
Java Platform, it is easy to use Java classes in JavaFX Script code. Compiled JavaFX Script is 
able to run on any platform which has a recent Java Runtime installed.
