Build an application step-by-step to see how concurrent and sequential animation of simple objects
 from point to point works in the JavaFX Script programming language. 

How do you create concurrent animation of two or more objects? How do you animate an object so that
 it begins to move after another object finishes? 

The animation of on-screen objects is a manipulation of one or more attributes of the object over 
time. The following applet shows basic timeline animation of simple shapes. The rectangles show 
concurrent animation and the circle shows sequential animation. The shapes are simple to reduce the
 code to as few lines as possible. The focus is on understanding how JavaFX animation works.
