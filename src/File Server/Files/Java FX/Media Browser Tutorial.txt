The Media Browser application is built in an iterative process that begins with simple architecture that runs
 on a desktop platform only. It then progressively develops to a sophisticated rich internet application that
 showcases features of the JavaFX platform and runs on the desktop, browser, and the JavaFX Mobile Emulator.

The architecture promotes rapid development and is adaptable to changes. It includes several class files that
 describe how the data is represented and accessed. With this type of architecture, it is easy to scale the 
application for use on different screens. 

The Media Browser tutorial gives you an example of the JavaFX platform capabilities. It gives you enough 
information to jump-start your development and gives you an understanding of the capabilities of the JavaFX
 language. The tutorial is not meant to teach the JavaFX language--for a comprehensive look at the language,
 see the JavaFX Script Programming Language and Building GUI Applications With JavaFX tutorials. 

The NetBeans source files are available for the final application, which runs on the JavaFX Mobile Emulator.
 The NetBeans source files are also available for each of the tasks described in the tutorial. Once you've 
uncompressed the file that you've downloaded, you can open the source files in the NetBeans IDE. As an added
 bonus, the source files include detailed comments from the developers. For a comprehensive look at how the 
application was developed, you can read the five modules and their respective tasks. Each module includes 
links to tutorials and articles that apply to the module contents.
