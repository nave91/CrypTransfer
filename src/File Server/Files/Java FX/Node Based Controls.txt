From its very beginning, JavaFX technology relied on the underlying Java client technology as much as possible, 
thus initial versions of the JavaFX Script programming language provided UI controls by including wrappers to 
the Java platform's GUI components (called Swing). While these components still exist in the javafx.ext.swing 
package, they offer limited scene graph integration and exist only in the JavaFX desktop profile. To overcome 
these limitations, JavaFX SDK 1.2 introduces a new set of user-interface (UI) controls which were designed and
implemented expressly for the JavaFX Script programming language and platform. These new UI controls are built
using nodes in the scene graph, so they are able to take full advantage of the visually rich features of the 
JavaFX platform, as well as, be portable across profiles (including mobile).
