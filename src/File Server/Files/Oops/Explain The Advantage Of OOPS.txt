Object-Oriented Programming has the following advantages over conventional approaches:
<h1>Advantages</h1>

OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface. 

OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones. 
OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.

oops is Small size 
Extensive use of function calls 
Loose typing -- unlike PASCAL 
Structured language 
Low level (BitWise) programming readily available

OOPs Concepts comes into picture due to following reasons.

Man can easily understand the concept of object and class as they are based on real-life scenario.
Maintenance of project becomes easy, as minor change in business rule require little modification rather than change in whole project.
Reusability of Code through Inheritance.
