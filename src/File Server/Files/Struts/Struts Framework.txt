Struts Framework
This page will give you a short overview of Struts Framework and its main components. After finishing reading this, continue on to the tutorial to create a simple Struts-based Web application. 

<h1>What Is the Struts Framework?</h1>
The Struts Framework is a standard for developing well-architected Web applications. It has the following features: 

<h1>Open source </h1>
Based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm, distinctly separating all three levels: 
Model: application state 
View: presentation of data (JSP, HTML) 
Controller: routing of the application flow 
Implements the JSP Model 2 Architecture 
Stores application routing information and request mapping in a single core file, struts-config.xml 
The Struts Framework, itself, only fills in the View and Controller layers. The Model layer is left to the developer.

It is Easy to learn and use
Unified error handling programmatically and declaratively

<h1>Architecture Overview</h1>
 
All incoming requests are intercepted by the Struts servlet controller. The Struts Configuration file struts-config.xml is used by the controller to determine the routing of the flow. This flows consists of an alternation between two transitions: From View to Action A user clicks on a link or submits a form on an HTML or JSP page. The controller receives the request, looks up the mapping for this request, and forwards it to an action. The action in turn calls a Model layer (Business layer) service or function. 
From Action to View After the call to an underlying function or service returns to the action class, the action forwards to a resource in the View layer and a page is displayed in a web browser.
